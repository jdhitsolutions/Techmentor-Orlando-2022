# Live360/Techmentor Orlando 2022

This repository contains my session material from [Live360/Techmentor](https://techmentorevents.com/ECG/live360events/Events/Orlando-2022/TechMentor.aspx) in November 2022. The PowerShell code from my demonstrations is offered AS-IS and should be considered eductional material. Nothing in this module should be considered production-ready.

To get the files, you can clone this repository or download a zip file. Click the `Code` button for options.

If you have follow-up questions, I encourage you to use the [Discussions](https://github.com/jdhitsolutions/Techmentor-Orlando-2022/discussions) section of this repository. Use the discussion section based on the conference session.
